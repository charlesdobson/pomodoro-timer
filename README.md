# Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple pomodoro timer application built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It allows the user to start a pomodoro timer for 25 minutes, take a short break of 5 mintues, or take a long break of 15 minutes.

# Motivation
I often use the pomodoro techinique while studying/working. There are quite a few pomodoro timer applications available but I was in search of one with a minimal design. I decided to build my own to learn more about creating button listeners in Javascript.
